    "On an early Sunday morning, Tom decided to go to the farmer's market. The market was buzzing with lively vendors selling fruits, vegetables, and baked goods. Freshly baked bread and ripe fruit filled the air with an irresistible aroma. Tom walked around, making selections for his weekly meals. He picked up crisp apples, plump tomatoes, and fresh basil.
